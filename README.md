# Task Management System (Python & Tkinter)

Welcome to my **Task Management System** project! ðŸŽ‰  
This is a simple Python application built using **Tkinter** for the user interface and **SQLite** for data storage. It allows users to manage tasks by adding, deleting, and marking them as complete.

## Features
- **Add tasks** with a name, description, deadline, category, and priority
- **Delete tasks** from the task list
- **Mark tasks as complete**, which moves them to a separate "Completed Tasks" list
- **Sort tasks** by priority and deadline for better organization
- **User-friendly interface** built with Tkinter widgets

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The core language used for this project
- **Tkinter**: For creating the graphical user interface (GUI)
- **SQLite**: For storing and managing task data
